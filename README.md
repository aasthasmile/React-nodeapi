# React-nodeapi


Understanding of the React packages :

1. express-validator: https://express-validator.github.io/docs/
It is a validator of the input elements in the api e.g. JSON Schema Validator, Custom error messages(length or max characters in a string),Sanitization methods( string notEmpty() or trim() or HTML escape() or Email isEmail() ) and Wildcards Verification.

    //Verification consist of error message chaining for password.
     req.check('password')
	        .isLength({ min: 6 })
	        .withMessage('Password must contain at least 6 characters') //if length is less than 6 
	        .matches(/\d/)
	        .withMessage('Password must contain a number');//if password doesnot have atleast one number 

2. Virtual Field (Password)
Values can be set manually or automatically with defined functionality.Virtual properties (password) donâ€™t get persisted in the database, because these are sensitive login information about the users which need to hash stored using hasing algorithm such as SHA256. React provides crypto to hash a password and store it into hashed_password. 

    // Encrypting Password using Crypto
     this.encryptedPassword = crypto.createHmac('sha256', this.salt)  // salt is uuid - unique universal identifier.
			.update(password)
			.digest('hex');


3.cookie-parser : https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser
Cookie parse maintains the request header element 'cookie' by populating it with a secret key that can be used at the time of the signin operation by the user.
